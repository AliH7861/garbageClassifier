# **EcoBin AI**

## Description
EcoBin AI is a smart web application that helps you classify household waste using AI. Simply sign up, upload any image, and our ResNet50 deep learning model predicts the correct Durham Region bin (e.g., Green Bin, Blue Box, Garbage). Your personal dashboard updates in real time track all submissions, fully customize bins (images & names), get analytics, and revert to official defaults with one click.

## Configuration
Before running the app, make sure to set up the required environment variables.

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory (you can copy from `.env.example`).

2. **Set your environment variables**, especially:

``` env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>
```
3. **Custom Bin Pictures**  
   You can replace the default bin images with your own by submitting pictures through the `picture.py` script.

   - This allows you to personalize how each bin looks when the AI model predicts.
   - You can revert back to the default Durham Region images anytime.

   > Make sure the uploaded image names match the category keys or update the logic in `picture.py` accordingly.
